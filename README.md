# Task Manager

A simple task manager application built using **Next.js**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Shadcn**. The app provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing tasks.

## Features

- **Create**: Add new tasks with a title, description.
- **Read**: View all tasks in a list format.
- **Update**: Edit task details (title, description).
- **Delete**: Remove tasks from the list.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Next.js**: A React-based framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications. Used for managing routes and rendering views.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for quickly building custom designs. It provides a default, responsive design that helps speed up development.
- **Shadcn**: A library for UI components in React, providing reusable and customizable components that follow design system guidelines.

### Design Decisions

- **TailwindCSS**: I decided to use TailwindCSS to streamline the styling process. As Iâ€™m not very comfortable with custom design work, I chose to stick with the default design and utility classes that TailwindCSS offers. This ensures a clean, responsive layout with minimal effort.
- **Shadcn**: For UI components, I opted for Shadcn since it provides a good set of pre-designed components that align with the overall clean and simple aesthetic I aimed for.
- **Minimalist UI**: I kept the user interface minimal and intuitive, focusing more on functionality than intricate design.
